🏗️ Welcome to the News App project! I've embarked on a journey to create a News App that's not just informative but also a joy to use. Here's a glimpse of what's under the hood:

Features and Technologies Used
🧩 MVVM Architecture: It's all about that clean separation of concerns, making our codebase organized and maintainable.

🏛️ Clean Architecture: The foundation of this app is rock solid, ensuring a robust, scalable, and testable solution.

📡 Rest APIs: Leveraging the power of real-time news updates to keep users informed with the latest headlines.

🔧 Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection that keeps everything in check, promoting a modular and efficient codebase.

🧪 JUnit: Ensuring the reliability of our app with thorough testing, because quality is paramount.

✨ Jetpack Compose: Crafting beautiful, interactive, and dynamic user interfaces that will make you fall in love with the news all over again!
